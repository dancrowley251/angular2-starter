# Angular2-Webpack-Starter
Kicking off a project and getting straight into code is awesome.  I complied this starter project to help you go straight into coding what users want.  

I envision the starter-project being used as a basis for your personal apps, your company apps, or a starting place for your hackathon team!

The goal of this project is to:

1. Greatly reduce pre-project configuration
2. Establish an easily understandable & standard reference architecture

I was inspired by the Angular.io write-up for [Angular2 for TypeScript | Webpack: an introduction
](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html) and some good talks by [John Papa](https://github.com/johnpapa).  This app code is 99% from the Angular.io write-up and the reference architecture is based on my experiences, influenced by thoughts by John Papa.

## Getting started
### Prerequisites 
This starter package requires global components.  Listed below are the components to install, links to help you better understand them and the npm commands.

#### [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/)
```
npm i webpack -g
```
#### [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
```
npm i typescript -g
```

### Making the Repo work
Once you clone the repo, navigate to the root directory.  The first priority is downloading all dependencies by running:
```
npm install 
```
Once all dependencies are installed successfully, we need to register the typescript features:
```
npm run postinstall
```
After successfully executing these two commands, you can boot the development server.  The application defaults to http://localhost:8080
```
npm start
```
